Template application for starting ES6

Copy the files to your development folder
I recommend installing eslint globally using: npm install -g eslint

Then, to start development. open a command prompt and run 'npm install' in this project folder

You then have three options available:
npm run dev             Run during development, watches your src directory and compiles the code to the build folder when you save changes
npm run buildDev        Run if you need to move compiled code to a dev web server
npm run buildProd       Run when you are ready to deploy to production, compiles and minifies code
